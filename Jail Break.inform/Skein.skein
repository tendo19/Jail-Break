You beg to the guard to let you free. "If you can't do the time, don't do the crime," he replies coldly. You'll go insane if you stay in prison any longer. Find a way to escape without being caught by the guard. Never be in the same room as him or he'll catch you. The only place you're safe from him is in the the cells.

You beg to the guard to let you free. "If you can't do the time, don't do the crime," he replies coldly. You'll go insane if you stay in prison any longer. Find a way to escape without being caught by the guard by never being in the same room as him. The only place you're safe from is in the cell.

You beg to the guard to let you free. "If you can't do the time, don't do the crime," he replies coldly. You'll go insane if you stay in prison any longer. Find a way to escape without being caught by the guard. Never be in the same room as him or he'll catch you. The only place you're safe from him is in the the cells.

You beg to the guard to let you free. "If you can't do the time, don't do the crime," he replies coldly. You'll go insane if you stay in prison any longer. Find a way to escape without being caught by the guard by never being in the same room as him. The only place you're safe from is in the cell.

You beg to the guard to let you free. "If you can't do the time, don't do the crime," he replies coldly. You'll go insane if you stay in prison any longer. Find a way to escape without being caught by the guard. Never be in the same room as him or he'll catch you. The only place you're safe from is in the cell.

You beg to the guard to let you free. "If you can't do the time, don't do the crime," he replies coldly. You'll go insane if you stay in prison any longer. Find a way to escape without being caught by the guard. Never be in the same room as him or he'll catch you. The only place you're safe from is in the cell.

You beg to the guard to let you free. "If you can't do the time, don't do the crime," he replies coldly. You'll go insane if you stay in prison any longer. Find a way to escape without being caught by the guard. Never be in the same room as him or he'll catch you. The only place you're safe from him is in the the cells.

        <command xml:space="preserve">ask him about security guards</command>
        <result xml:space="preserve">There are three security guards in this prison. The first one walks around the prison. You should avoid being in the same room as him. He always takes same route, so you should be able to figure where he's headed.

One of them is guarding security checkpoint 1 and the last one is guarding security checkpoint 2. You need to find a way to sneak past all three of them if you want to escape. Whatever you do, don't make any noise.

The only place you're truly safe is in the cells. If the guard comes, just go into one of the cells and don't act suspicious.

The security guard is in Prison Bathroom and is headed towards Cell Room 1.You see Joe. He has been in this prison for 50 years, so he probably knows a lot about it. Try talking to him.
The guard is coming! Hide in my cell!
